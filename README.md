## EMT-App Frontend:

This repo holds the frontend to our EMT-App where would-be users can interact with out backend and database in the GUI built with Appsmith.

## Setup:

By setting up the backend repo all three docker containers should be running. You can then go to any browser and go to localhost:8080 to navigate to appsmith. The frontend project should populate
into your list of projects and you can view the beta version of our frontend.
